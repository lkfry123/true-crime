### Early years
Born in 1906 near Plainfield, Wisconsin, Ed Gein grew up under a strict, isolated household dominated by his mother.

### 1945–1957
Following his mother’s death, Gein’s isolation deepened. Grave exhumations and craftwork using human remains are alleged to have begun during this period.

### 1957 arrest
The search of Gein’s farm in November 1957 uncovered shocking evidence that would imprint his name on American culture.

### Aftermath
Gein was found legally insane and confined for life. The case inspired decades of cultural retellings, often straddling the line between fact and myth.
