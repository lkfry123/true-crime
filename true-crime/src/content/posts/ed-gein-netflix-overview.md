Ed Gein’s crimes have cast a long shadow over American pop culture. From inspiring characters like Norman Bates and Leatherface to reshaping the way we talk about rural isolation and horror, his story continues to surface in new retellings.

## What the documentary covers

The Netflix documentary revisits key facts: Gein’s upbringing in Plainfield, Wisconsin; the loss of his mother; the exhumations; and the 1957 arrest that shocked the nation.

## What it gets right

It avoids sensationalism in several places, foregrounding the community’s response and the investigators’ methodical work.

## What it gets wrong (or glosses over)

The blurred line between myth and record remains a problem. Some sequences conflate documented evidence with lore that grew around the case.

## Why it matters

Understanding the source material behind iconic horror figures helps separate cultural projection from the historical record.
